# Rock Paper Snail

[My Notes](notes.md)

I really wanted to play rock paper scissors but with a snail because I thought it would be funny so that will be the entire point of my project. Users will log in, then I'll have like 4 images for gerald the snail and some sprites for the users hand, and it'll just be a pretty simple game of rock paper scissors. I think it's unique enough while not being overcomplex so that I can focus on learning the other parts of the course.

Go test your wits against our professional snail and then compare your score with others around the world. Do you have what it takes to beat a snail in rock paper scissors?

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Overall structure of site, will contain three pages. One for signing in, one for the game page, one for leaderboard.
- **CSS** - Styling of application that fits on different screen sizes, correct spacing, and good color choice.
- **React** - Ability to login, display of the current match of rock paper sicssors, leaderboard display, and loser chat display.
- **Service** - Use of external source Colormind to make theme of website change, Backend service that will handle
  - login
  - receiving user input
  - evaluates match of rock paper scissors
- **DB/Login** - Stores users credentials and high score in database. User cannot play against the snail without an account, to avoid errors in storing highscores for nonexistent users.
- **WebSocket** - When a user loses against the snail, it will be displayed to all other users.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - Everything scales according to the screen and I hide some elements if it's too small.
- [x] **Application elements** - I'm guessing this means like my leaderboard, loser chat, etc? If so all of that has been formated to how I want it.
- [x] **Application text content** - I learned how to add a nice shadow behind text so a lot of my site uses white text with a black gradient behind it to make it pop out so that's neat..
