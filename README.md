# Rock Paper Snail

[My Notes](notes.md)

I really wanted to play rock paper scissors but with a snail because I thought it would be funny so that will be the entire point of my project. Users will log in, then I'll have like 4 images for gerald the snail and some sprites for the users hand, and it'll just be a pretty simple game of rock paper scissors. I think it's unique enough while not being overcomplex so that I can focus on learning the other parts of the course.
