# Rock Paper Snail

[My Notes](notes.md)

I really wanted to play rock paper scissors but with a snail because I thought it would be funny so that will be the entire point of my project. Users will log in, then I'll have like 4 images for gerald the snail and some sprites for the users hand, and it'll just be a pretty simple game of rock paper scissors. I think it's unique enough while not being overcomplex so that I can focus on learning the other parts of the course.

Go test your wits against our professional snail and then compare your score with others around the world. Do you have what it takes to beat a snail in rock paper scissors?

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.
