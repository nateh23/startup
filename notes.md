## AWS Notes
none :shrug:

## HTML Notes
Okay this was on the checkbox of things to do I usually take notes in different places but hey here's what I did for HTML
- created and structured pages based on my mockup
- placeholder for my websocket view
- placerholder for my databse view
- my third party service will be color and theme stuff so I cant really.... mock it up in html?
- structured my pages right
- added some images for the game
- I'm assuming textual content just means like text where needed?

## CSS stuff
i'd say big thing to remember is multiple classes can be thrown in one tag I want to learn more about inheritance of classes too through the page

## React
Luckily I messed up a lot so I got a lot of practice in this one, biggest thing is just remembering all css files get accessed and argue with each other, and also that I need to give .sh proper permissions to run. ALSO the cmd for deploying is super long haha gotta remember how it works

## React 2.0
dude this was a LOT basically dont forget your colormind setup in app.jsx and stuff!

## Service
next time... pick an api that just naturally uses HTTPS instead of only http... it will make your life so much easier bro
but hey now i know how proxy servers work idk if theres a downside to them but hey we'll see

## Database
This was honestly super easy, I guess the biggest thing is write your code to be prepaed to accept database usage later on? Like this would've been a lot harder if I had poorly set it up starting out.

## Websocket
This took a little bit longer to conceptually understand but PLEASE remember to setup your debug proxy correctly in the future because that was a terrible thing to be stuck on haha after that it was also important to make a connection on the server AND properly send your data through the websocket correctly
