## HTML Notes
Okay this was on the checkbox of things to do I usually take notes in different places but hey here's what I did for HTML
- created and structured pages based on my mockup
- placeholder for my websocket view
- placerholder for my databse view
- my third party service will be color and theme stuff so I cant really.... mock it up in html?
- structured my pages right
- added some images for the game
- I'm assuming textual content just means like text where needed?
