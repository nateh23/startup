## HTML Notes
Okay this was on the checkbox of things to do I usually take notes in different places but hey here's what I did for HTML
- created and structured pages based on my mockup
- placeholder for my websocket view
- placerholder for my databse view
- my third party service will be color and theme stuff so I cant really.... mock it up in html?
- structured my pages right
- added some images for the game
- I'm assuming textual content just means like text where needed?

## CSS stuff
i'd say big thing to remember is multiple classes can be thrown in one tag I want to learn more about inheritance of classes too through the page

## React
Luckily I messed up a lot so I got a lot of practice in this one, biggest thing is just remembering all css files get accessed and argue with each other, and also that I need to give .sh proper permissions to run. ALSO the cmd for deploying is super long haha gotta remember how it works
